The Artificial Light Texture (ALT) technology is a revolutionary new method for monitoring vital signs such as heart rate and respiration rate. Unlike traditional methods such as ECG or respiratory belts, this technology is non-invasive and non-contact, making it more comfortable and convenient for the person being monitored.

The technology utilizes a video camera and a special light source to capture images of a person's body. The special light source generates an artificial light texture, which is projected onto the person's body. This light texture is designed to impart an additional light texture to a part of the person's body, which is captured by the video camera. The added light texture serves as an "amplification medium" for small body movements, allowing the technology to detect even subtle variations in the body related to heart rate and respiration rate.

The technology utilizes advanced image processing algorithms to analyze the video frames captured by the camera and detect variations in the illumination distribution, shape distribution, size distribution, location distribution of the elements of the added light texture, and/or variations in the number of those elements. These variations are then used to calculate the heart rate and respiration rate of the person with high accuracy.

One of the key advantages of the ALT technology is its ability to work in a non-contact fashion. The skin of the person does not have to be exposed to the video camera for the technology to work. This allows for monitoring vital signs in various scenarios, such as when the person is covered by a thick blanket or wearing loose-fitting clothes, or in situations where direct contact with the skin is not feasible or desirable.

In addition, the technology is able to detect vital signs even when a person is completely hidden under a thick blanket, by picking up movements or variations in the shape of objects that are in contact with the person's body, such as a chair, a blanket, a bed, or a floor. This makes it possible to monitor vital signs in scenarios such as sleep monitoring, where traditional methods may not be feasible.

The ALT technology can be implemented using inexpensive computing and image capture devices such as Raspberry Pi single-board computer and Pi NoIR camera, making it cost-effective and easy to implement. It is also compatible with light emitting elements of various consumer electronics devices such as light projectors of standalone or embedded depth sensing devices like Microsoft Kinect, Intel RealSense cameras, and Occipital Structure Sensor.

With its non-invasive, non-contact and cost-effective features, the ALT technology has a wide range of potential applications including medical settings, sports training, home healthcare, remote monitoring, research and development in fields such as human-computer interaction, and robotics.
